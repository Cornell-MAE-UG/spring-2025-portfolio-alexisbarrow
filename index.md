## About Me


[My profile photo](assets/images/profilephoto.JPG)


 
My name is Alexis Barrow, and I am a current Sophomore at Cornell University studying for a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Aerospace Engineering. I am currently on the project team Cornell Electric Vehicles on the Drivetrain subteam, where we as a team work to make a sustainable, level 2 autonomous electric vehicle. This summer, I will be working for General Atomics Aeronautical Systems where I will be working in unmanned air vehicles. I have passions for quantum mechanics research and aerospace engineering, but also simple things such as running, coffee, and painting!
