This motor mount is a piece I designed for my project team, where I work on the drivetrain subsystem. We work to make the drivetrain assembly of an autonomous, electric vehicle. While I worked on a variety of parts on the drivetrain subsystem, my primary focus was on the motor mount.

The design of the motor mount has a primary focus on prevent deformation of the motor-gearbox combination it the car as it drives. Alignment is also another key factor, as the design accomodates for the driveshaft and makes sure the entire drivetrain assembly stays properly aligned, an important aspect of a power transmission system. 

The design per assembly involves two plates, one that interfaces with the gearbox, and one that interfaces with the wheel-well chassis wall. Connecting the two of them are four spacers, which are bolted into the plates on either side. While the gearbox plate bolts only go through the gearbox plate into the spacers, the other bolts go through the support block plate, the chassis wall, and then through the chassis wall plate into the spacers.
