This multi-tool is a water bottle brush designed for my Introduction to Mechanical Design class. It was primarily designed using Autodesk Fusion 360 as well as a variety of scrappy prototypes. A multitude of designs were created both solely on CAD and physically materialized before a final design had been chosen, where we presented a pitch to our professor and several course staff. 

The water bottle was designed with convenience, aesthetics, and multi-functionality in mind. It seeks to be a tool that replaces the multitude of water bottle cleaning materials commonly taking up space in kitchen spaces, such as straw cleaners, bottle brushes, and small sponge pieces. This design seeks to make cleaning water bottles more convenienent in terms of tools used, as well as accomodate for a variety of differently sized water bottles.
